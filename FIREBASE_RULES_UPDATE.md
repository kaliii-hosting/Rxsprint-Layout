# Firebase Security Rules Update Required

The Notes feature and Voice Transcription require updating your Firebase Firestore security rules to allow read/write access to the 'notes' collection.

## Current Error
```
Error loading notes: FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

## Required Firestore Rules Update

Add the following rules to your Firebase Firestore security rules:

```javascript
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Existing rules for medications...
    
    // Add this rule for notes collection (includes voice notes)
    match /notes/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Storage Rules Update

Also update Firebase Storage rules to allow voice note uploads:

```javascript
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow voice notes upload
    match /voice-notes/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Update

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project (cvse-32388)
3. Navigate to Firestore Database â†’ Rules
4. Add the notes collection rules
5. Click "Publish"

## Alternative: More Secure Rules

For production, consider implementing authentication-based rules:

```javascript
match /notes/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

This would require implementing Firebase Authentication in your app.

## Note
Until these rules are updated, the Notes feature will not be able to save or retrieve data from Firebase.
